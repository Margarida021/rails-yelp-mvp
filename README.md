Asking yourself what user stories will compose your application and which routes you will need is a very important step in your web-app building process. Routes should exactly mirror your product’s user stories. So let’s define our minimal product here:

<!-- A visitor can see the list of all restaurants.
GET "restaurants" -->

<!-- A visitor can add a new restaurant, and be redirected to the show view of that new restaurant.
GET "restaurants/new"
POST "restaurants" -->
=======
<!-- A visitor can see the details of a restaurant, with all the reviews related to the restaurant.
GET "restaurants/38"

A visitor can add a new review to a restaurant
GET "restaurants/38/reviews/new"
POST "restaurants/38/reviews"
And that’s it! -->
